# Release Notes - ResearchSpace 4.0.0

> The ResearchSpace codebase has been developed for more than a decade. During this period practices and approaches to semantic modelling have changed, ontologies have evolved, and UI/UX have become more sophisticated. This release brings with it an exhaustive review of how to build on ResearchSpace as a platform and offers a more accessible starting point for users and developers with default templates and complex customisations that encourage good practices when creating a ResearchSpace-based projects.

> The building blocks of the ResearchSpace platform are ontologies, knowledge patterns, and its templates that enable constructing interactive user interfaces with mechanisms for authoring, viewing and searching [ResearchSpace documentation](https://documentation.researchspace.org/resource/rsp:Start).
