    <h1>Semantic lazy tree</h1>

    <p>The component is best for tree-based visualization, navigation, browsing through sub-tree structures 
      or hierarchies with ability to use keyword filtering.</p>

    <p>The main difference from <semantic-link iri='[[resolvePrefix "Help:SemanticTree"]]' class="text-link-action" target="_blank">semantic tree</semantic-link>
       is that data in Lazy Tree is lazily loaded by small portions as the user explores the hierarchy by expanding branches. 
    This allows the component to render large hierarchical structures with thousands of nodes without any large impact on the performance.</p>
