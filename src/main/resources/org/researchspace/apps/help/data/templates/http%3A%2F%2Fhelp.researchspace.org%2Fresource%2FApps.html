      The platform offers simple extension points to build, bundle and deploy lightweight "apps" along with the platform 
      without the need of changing the platform binary or re-compiling the platform. <br>
      Sources of an "app" can be put under the source control and a packaged version of an "app" can be deployed 
      as a docker container volume along with the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
